## Running the application

### To run the Local Version of the App
You will need to have [node] and [yarn] both installed on your machine to run the app.

- Clone this repository and make sure you are in this directory (the one containing `README.md`!)
- Run `yarn && yarn start` to start the app
- Visit `localhost:3000` in a browser

# ECSD Tech Test Automation

- Open a new terminal and navigate within the directory `/src/test/e2e/`
- enter command 'node ArrayChallenge.Test'

NOTE: At the moment the final popup will give failure message as the response is not validated locally.
